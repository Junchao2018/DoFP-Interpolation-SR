# DoFP-Interpolation-SR
Sparse representation based interpolation method for DoFP polarimeters

This is the implementation code for paper "Sparse representation-based demosaicing method for microgrid polarimeter imagery", the download link is : https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-43-14-3265


Note: The PSNR results are different with those in papers, because I make a modification on the code. However, the results are consistent, SR method outperforms previous methods.

When you use this code, please cite the following paper:
